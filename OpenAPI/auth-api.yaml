      summary: Used exclusively by the Follett AASP server to obtain grants for API access.
      description: >-
        This API is exclusively used by Follett and specialized for usage
        by the AASP server for creating access tokens, which can be used for Follett
        applications and services to access Destiny.

        When an application makes a request to AASP to get an access token for
        Destiny, this API is invoked by AASP to obtain grants (permissions) and
        principal (user) information.  This information is digitally signed into
        the access token by AASP so that Destiny can trust this information when
        that token is provided as part of an API call.  When a Destiny API is
        invoked, the grant and principal information of the access token are
        used to ensure proper access to the given API before proceeding
        with the execution.

        <br><br> Permissions are gathered by looking both at the application
        identifiers (appId, appFamilyIds) and the principal (principalIds,
        subcontextId).  At least one kind of application identifier must be
        specified, and the Destiny Administrator must have configured a service
        account for that identifier.  The principal is found by using both the
        principalId and subcontextId to find the user and the associated
        permissions in the database.  The final permissions returned by this
        API are the INTERSECTION of permissions between the application and
        the principal.  This means that a required permission for the API
        must be given to both the application and the user by the Destiny administrator.

        <br><br> An appId is required and zero or more appFamilyIds can be included.  
        Destiny will attempt to match an API account using the appId, and then each appFamilyId.
        After matching the appId and appFamilyIds the permissions for ALL
        are combined in a UNION before being combined in an INTERSECTION with
        the principal permissions to produce the final grants.

        <br><br> A principal is not required to make an API call.  If no
        principal identifier is specified, then the grants are just computed
        based upon the application identifiers and no principal identifier will be returned.
